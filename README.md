# HPC Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) course. It includes various tests and implementations related to parallel computing using different tools and libraries. Below is an overview of the assignments and their contents.

## Assignment 1

This folder contains performance tests using the **OSU Micro-Benchmarks** (OSU). These tests are designed to measure performance and communication overhead in parallel systems.

### Contents:
- **OSU Tests**: Various performance benchmarks to assess latency, bandwidth, and MPI (Message Passing Interface) performance.

## Assignment 2

This folder contains two parallel implementations:
- **Quicksort**: A parallel implementation of the Quicksort algorithm using MPI for fast data sorting.
- **Mandelbrot**: A parallel implementation of the Mandelbrot set computation, leveraging parallel computing to generate fractals efficiently.

## Usage

To run the programs or tests within each assignment, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions in the provided source files.
