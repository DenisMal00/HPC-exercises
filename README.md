# HPC Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the High-Performance Computing (HPC) course. It includes various tests and implementations related to parallel computing using different tools and libraries. Below is an overview of the assignments and their contents.

## Assignment 1

This folder contains performance tests using the **OSU Micro-Benchmarks** (OSU). These tests are designed to measure performance and communication overhead in parallel systems.

### Contents:
- **OSU Tests**: Various performance benchmarks to assess latency, bandwidth, and MPI (Message Passing Interface) performance.

## Assignment 2

This folder contains two parallel implementations:
- **Quicksort**: A parallel implementation of the Quicksort algorithm using MPI for fast data sorting.
- **Mandelbrot**: A parallel implementation of the Mandelbrot set computation, leveraging parallel computing to generate fractals efficiently.

### Contents:
- **Quicksort**: Efficient sorting algorithm implemented with parallel processing.
- **Mandelbrot**: Fractal generation using parallel computation for improved performance.

## Usage

To run the programs or tests within each assignment, navigate to the respective folder and follow the instructions in the provided source files.

Make sure to have the necessary tools (e.g., OpenMP, MPI) installed to compile and execute the programs.
